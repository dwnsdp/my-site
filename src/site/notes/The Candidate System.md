The UK is a **Representative** Democracy.
This means you get to vote on who represents you (and everyone else who lives in your constituency). The people who actually run the country, all except one, are out of your specific control.
All of the MPs voted in by different constituents are then picked by the Prime Minister to do different roles.
Parties select candidates to be MPs (like a football team picking players) and if the party has the majority the party leader becomes the Prime Minister.

I think we can see why this is flawed:

- **You are forced to vote for your preferred parties candidate** in your area, even if you disagree with *their* views
- **Voting for a party means voting for a whole set of policies**, even if you disagree with some of them. This is obviously the biggest flaw, it causes a lot of people not to vote.
- **You don't even directly vote for a party**, if your area is heavily in favour of party X then a vote for party Y will do nothing at all, even if the country is in favour of X.
- **Third parties often fail to gain ground** as voting for them would be political suicide.

My idea is voting instead for a candidate for each system.
Let's call it the **Candidate System**
Using health as an example, but this would apply to all roles. Anyone can signup to be the minister of health. They write down what they would do in that role, and then we vote for which minister we want. This way we are voting for which policies we like in a specific area. When pitching this idea to someone I was told we would still need a Prime Minister, but I don't think we do. We could always introduce ministers for the roles the PM does, or assign some of his roles to an existing minister.
