I have spent some time googling around, and not really finding anything. So I thought I would share what I found in the end.

The best app for use with a stylus and a 2 in 1 laptop is **Obsidian with Excalidraw**.
It work's flawlessly with a stylus and allows for you to use all of obsidian's note taking features like linking notes. Everything being accessible with another app in the future. A plethora of themes, etc, etc. Excalidraw also has a proper pen mode with pressure sensitivity. Not drawing with your fingers, and the interface is clean and simple.

If you do not value my opinion try out these **alternatives**:
	**Rnote**, **Xournal**, **LibreOffice Draw**, **Excalidraw Web**: seems to also have proper stylus support but file management will kill you slowly.
