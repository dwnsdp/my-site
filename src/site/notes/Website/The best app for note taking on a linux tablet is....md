I have spent some time googling around, and not really finding anything. So I thought I would share what I found in the end.

The best app for use with a stylus and a 2 in 1 laptop is Obsidian with Excalidraw.
It work's flawlessly with a stylus and allows for you to use all of obsidian's note taking features like linking notes. Everything being accessible with another app in the future. A plethora of themes, etc, etc. Excalidraw also has a proper pen mode with pressure sensitivity. Not drawing with your fingers, and the interface is clean and simple.

Before coming to this decision I tried out these apps:
	Rnote: Best I tried other than excalidraw. Simple UI. File management. GTK4
	Xournal: has a horrible bloated UI with every feature you will never use and none that you will.
	LibreOffice Draw: This is not a serious suggestion, right?
