> [!Type] Short Story

His name is A. Thomas Thompson. The A is for Alfred, though nobody knows this. He lives in a flat in a central London and works at a stand in which he sells newspapers along with other things that people may need such as a cigarettes and sweet drinks. Thomas is a news agent.

It is late august of 1993 and Thomas is growing old, he would like to do something that is remembered. So he sits down with a pen and paper and begins to sketch out what he might like spending his time on.
"What are you doing?" says a women as she purchases her morning paper, glancing at the piece of graphing paper covered in crossed out ideas.
"Inventory" responds Thomas; shutting down any chance of a conversation, his voice flat. The women goes back to her conversation with her nephew.
But he wasn't taking inventory, Thomas, in fact, and though you never would have guessed it for the newspaper wrinkles he wore on his faces, he had just had an brain wave.
He was to start writing down the conversations he heard at his news stand and compile them into a magazine, he stood up, quite suddenly, and grabbed a fresh notebook from the shelf behind him, before sitting back down and listening

About three quarters of an hour later, Thomas hears his first piece of dialogue that he would transcribe into his book. Two teens, perhaps a quarter of his age where discussing what would become of a local café after the owner had died last night.
Thomas did not understand all of the words used but he understood the significance. He had been a friend of the café owner and a regular patron. These teens, all though using language perhaps frowned upon by the older generations, were saying what people wanted to here, not only those things that journalists wanted to say.

Over the next month Thomas would not only catch these serious matters, but also much more humorous, light hearted snippets of conversations, things often grossly out of contexts that caught the fancy of the people of London: The goings on of Jessica's now ex boyfriend. Or the things Margaret did after a few pints.
And then, once a sizable amount has been captured he heads to the local printing shop and pays from his funds to print a few copies which he sells at his stand.

And he keeps doing this for two mores years. On the third of march 1996 a man walks up to the stand and asks about the magazine.
"Keep doing them" he says "my nan can hardly get out the flat these days, but these give her a glimmer of the street, of *real* peoples lives."
Thomas leans his head back and keeps listening

A week later the hatch on the news agents is lowered and a letters lies unread on the floor reading "Thank you for listening"

Years later, a young archivist finds a box marked “Conversations, 1993–96.”
It becomes a small exhibit at the British Library.  
The card beside it reads simply: Collected by A. Thomas Thompson, news agent.
