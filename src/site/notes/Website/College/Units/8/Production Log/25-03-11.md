Today I was writing about aesthetics. I fetched a book from the library about typography but unfortunately it was not as useful as I thought it would be. I spent a good bit of time reading about different elements of fonts before trying to choose one that fit my requirements (serifed, un-uniform) but in end I choose a font I likely would have picked anyway.

I also wrote about colour theory. Which was also unfortunate. I did not have much to write you see, as the colour theory was pretty much done for me by the fact I am using the textures already in the game. I instead wrote about why these textures work but I reckon this comes across quite shallow.

I struggled to write about the aesthetic as most choices, although made by me, were made over a year ago for the game, with no notes. Stylistically for the cinematic I will just try to match the game as much as possible.
