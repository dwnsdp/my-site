Some research is done, but I now need to get on to the technical research. Can I make this? What software will I use? Etc. Etc.

I spent some time working on a shader for the explosion today.

I have a mesh of a sphere.

In Geonodes I create points on itâ€™s surface and at those points I create spheres.

I then convert it to a volume before converting it back to a mesh again and subdivide. This creates a mesh that looks like this:

The shading is really simple.

I have an emission shader that uses the fresnel node (angle to camera from position) to index a colour.

Whilst trying somethings, however, I have realised that just the act of converting to a volume, back to a mesh, and subdividing, creates a nobbly enough mesh.

There is still something I dislike about it though: the lack of transparency.

Apon trying it out I have decided I prefer it without. As it creates a more toony look.
