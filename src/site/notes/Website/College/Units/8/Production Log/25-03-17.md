Today I was doing sketches of Bryndruid, the capitol building that’s gonna fulminate against existence.

The sketches are based on the original sketches I did in my pocket note book about a year ago, they are based on nothing and although they look quite nice they are definitely not perfect.

In a ditch attempt to remedy the situation I sent an email to a friend about it, trying to get another set of eyes to see what the problem was. They suggested I fix the balance, which was fair enough, the balance was off. But ‘pon fixing the balance I was still not exactly blown away.

So I went to the library and tried to find some info on buildings. I found a book about castles and tried to make sure my next plan fit the principles. It needed sloping walls at the bottom to stop people climbing the walls. It needed a tower on each corner to fend against attack. And importantly; it needed to look cool.

I then went on Pinterest and found a bunch of castles / universities / capital buildings that looked as cool as I could find and picked the elements I wanted to steal, making another attempt at design, stealing the elements I like.
