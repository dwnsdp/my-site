Back after the half term and I think I need to do a catch up on my work. What have I done, and what is yet to happen.

I have got a video!

<iframe title="MCRPG Cinematic Intro" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_M9f696hX40?feature=oembed" height="113" width="200" allowfullscreen="" allow="fullscreen" style="aspect-ratio: 1.76991 / 1; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>

So here we go with a detailed breakdown of the video and how I made it.

# Video Breakdown

- The font is IM FELL. The font I believe is based around 1800s printing’s aesthetic but I think for most people it just creates a sort of old fashioned look. This is good for a few reasons. Firstly and most obviously, the setting is fantasy, fantasy being based on nostalgia for the past. But it is also good because the old fashioned look mirrors how the text talks about it being a golden age.
    
- I had to line up the music to crescendo when the dialogue does. And I got very  lucky with it lining up almost exactly. However for the first ten seconds there is no music. I do not want people to think there is no audio as that can be very irritating, when a film starts silent for instances and you are trying to work out why your speakers are not working. So I simply inserted some wind noise and let that act as a problem solver.

At this point, the music starts.

I wrote this piece in MuseScore, which is a piece of open-source notation software with some of the best orchestral VSTs known to man. You really, genuinely can barely tell that the music is being played by a computer.

I cannot lie, I have not done music theory for years, and I kind of just do it all based on whether it sounds good or not, but I will try my best to run you through it.

The piece is written in Cm, with a monophonic melody that is incredibly disjunct. The tune holds together, though, as although disjunct for bars 1–3, 5–7, etc., beats 2, 4, 6, and 8 in an 8/8 bar are either the first or third of the scale depending on the chord.

The piece is ABCB (although really all sections are the same with different instrumentation).

I am over all so happy with this piece. And no amount of spewing terminology can possibly explain why. Because really I just made the piece up by coming up with a tune on the piano, playing it on my cello, transcribing it to a violin. Adding chords (which was easy as really it is just incredibly segmented arpeggios) and then at some point deciding I wanted a choir. Which is a completely different tune that I once again just sorta came up with an I cannot tell you why.

You could call it… vibes based composing‽ Anyways…

As we go through the screenshots, I will tell you when we hit the different sections.

Right now, we are at the A part — the tune played slowly with a solo violin.

The main part of the show has started and there is much to talk about. Before we get to the shot itself it is worth noting we are now in the B part of the song heavier instrumentation

**Modelling**

This was made simply by creating a cube and extruding and insetting. It is all traced from sketches I drew from all angles. Of course the sketch does not all line up but it is a fine base.

Of course my original aim was simulations and so the next step was spending two weeks using geometry nodes to turn my model into millions of bricks, before deciding they did not fit the pixel artish style I was going for. Sunk cost fallacy told me to try procedural texturing making the bricks look like pixel art. But I decided the only real sensible option was to say simulations are not going to work, and I had to except that they were not going to work but I still needed a final product, perfect or not. So I changed to just having an orb that engulfs the building.

In hindsight I would definitely say this was a good idea. And even the base model was better than work I have done in the past

The explosion is created with a very resource wasteful geonodes setup that basically just creates a significant amount of spheres and remeshes them into one vague blob. It is then shaded to posterize the pink colours

I say wasteful because I very easily could have just used a texture or displacement map to create the bobbles.

**Texturing**

One of the biggest problems I had in this process was the UV unwrapping. You see I am using pixel art textures from the game. On the flat surfaces this works fine but on the cones on the roof and such the pixel art effectively creates a grid which highlights the distortion.

And in the end I dealt with this by… ignoring it and hope no one notices. If I had not been on a deadline I would have found a solution but you cannot always be happy with your work.

**Animation**

The camera is procedurally animated by running along a curve pointing at an empty object. This allows me to make a smooth camera move with minimal effort although it does take away some of the control of manual keyframing.

Darkness

We are now in the C part of the song with two choir parts.

Musically we are now back in what I would call B² which is just B¹ but in half speed with the violin part copied to the cellos.

The blender scene is very basic right now, a simple model with a sky texture animated to sunrise.

We will talk more about it in a second when it cuts to inside the gravestone.

But right now I want to talk about the fact it does not look like a gravestone as it is based on the fantasy idea rather than a real gravestone. In hindsight. And what I may do tomorrow. Is add some text with a simple RIP.

That shadow of a tree by the way is just a PNG cutout of a tree of screen

The inside of the gravestone where the slit lets the light in really is just some fog and a png of a skeleton.

Although I did have to do the slight work around of boosting the light by 100x

I kind of hate the camera animation in this shot.

It feels kind of way to close to a robot arm and takes away from the skeleton as you begin to focus on this amateur CGI of unrealistic camera moves.

One final point for this little video breakdown.

The final cadence of the song is played on timpani. Which is basically in audible when played on small speakers as it is entirely bass. Meaning to some people it may appear like there is not cadence, making the song feel horrifically incomplete.
