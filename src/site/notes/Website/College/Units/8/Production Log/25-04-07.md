I have been ill for a while, but back on track now. I did a few things whilst not well enough to evaluate but well enough to make tweaks in blender; letâ€™s quick fire through them. (bearing in mind my memory is a little foggy)
Import the explosion into the project
Animate the camera
At first I was doing manual keying but I then switched to moving the camera along a curve
Add compositing for bloom and a ridiculous amount of lens distortion
This, mainly, to be honest, is to hide my shoddy work. I am not really that sure about this change.
Switch to using textures from the game instead of the geonode based tiles
This is a really big change. I spent quite a while working on the tile setups. I do, at them moment, think this is the best way forward. Textures allow me to rapidly generate and not worry about performance
