Today I made a survey with some questions about cinematics with a key statistic I was trying to get: Do you prefer cinematics rendered in game or externally. Of cause external means it looks better but rendered in game means it fits in more. I cannot ask this however as people are quite bad at being impartial. I instead devised a devious plan. I made it seem that the form was about something else:

When did you last play a game (discarded info)

What was the game you played (discarded info)

Did the game have cinematics (If not, leave the poor sods alone)

Did you like the cinematics (Now we get onto the good stuff)

Did you notice if they were rendered in game or not (This is key)

  

Using whether they liked the cinematics and whether they were rendered in game or not I could calculate if people overally preferred games with prerendered cinematics.

This clearly shows that people prefer in game renders.

  

Getting onto the problems

There were several problems:

1. I had to redo the survey on paper since the digital one was abused and filled with spam. This was fine but introduces bias of how the question was asked.
    
2. The sample size was not large enough, note the fact exactly a third of people said cinematics not rendered in game were not immersive? That is because three people out of the thirty I questioned got that far. This makes the data pretty much pointless
    
3. For some reason I choose the word immersive instead of good? Of cause those in game are more immersive, that is what is going for them, that is the upside of rendering in game. This makes the survey also pointless.
    
4. I should have asked people to rate from 1 - 10 instead of just a yes or no. Because in general people would just say “yes” because to say no means it has to be worse than average. Yes does not mean ten out of ten, but rather often, just “yeah, it was alright I guess”  
    Rating from one to ten I could have had a nice graph, hopefully, with a large enough sample size, with a nice and obvious curve, slightly closer to the one end on one of them
    

Unfortunately I do not have the time to do it again, and if I did I have no way of fixing the sample size.
