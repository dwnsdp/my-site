Today was all about the castle.

I blocked it out with cubes, cones, and cylinders, using the sketches as reference.

I then spent a while making geonode graphs to make massive amounts of bricks.

For the towers I am using the base of a curve, I instance cubes on each vertice before instancing the whole thing vertically on a line, with each layer having a random z rotation. Unfortunately since it rotates around the origin, which cannot be changed, I cannot have any wall shape with a curve. I instead sacrificed my will to live and created a different node setup for a wall, a roof, a cylinder, and a corner piece. They all work in much the same way.

The rooves / cones are meant to be tilelike

But I decided I did not like this look and would prefer a more clean, simple, cone
