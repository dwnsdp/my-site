I did some sketches of some design in Photoshop

Before slotting it into the design in Figma with some copy.

But of course these are not final products and instead mockups. To make the real thing we have to pop into blender.![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe48NSOINAR6GYUO41iW822-91NlrPM5T8Oazfr9f32PTCT5PUXjv3S89JftqEhZIyVzfR7fij7hOYTzECBhvswd-RsmlfY1rhNYRdDcesm_eN3_ED9Wx_lIfsxDChVardMAHC_?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb)

I made a toon shader I can uses to simulate that space age, grainy, poster design. It is all plugged into a group so I can access parameters from object view.

It basically just posterizes the output of a BSDF and adds grain (or another texture) to smoothly transition, but with a few more steps, this shader is very versatile and allows me to make basically any toon shader.

After that it was time to start creating the first poster, which was meant to be this one:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfibV1x-eHiCTpHNmL-CCn2tTHQag0bMkbxLVGqdPsWEpzaRKcaXCQjeMEpXLEDnmZj-68Ip-TjWiENfAcsusIj9ZA6VzzV5KcNkoZHTbkgj_11Qukmq5Dk8KiurdM64hBe8doOyw?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb)

I got into blender and created a massive plane, subdivided, and sculpted it to form a landscape:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf1i6pGmEaEmuNIHSuF460T3xbS_9z_PKuYMYXKnoX3gmaeGH0koO5KzU3E9AQbS90TXA-IH_BT0QOX9HOFPZXkXySB-wz6luHhgdDIEQk65Cep5eLKe6zlczwiWtXvBvlH120CSg?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb)

I then added a road by creating a spline and distributed cars along it:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcS0Gc7mDAGXPRAv4-1LLai3LmHudnml1LsPcNNvo-pgfBCvX0KtFXjTdNxsD8Vhm96YANoBP7Ua5gMlj7ZAyiTWrTcizpRod9BD6ssEzMj5bZ80tSno-USvthzdpO9VFIUm33R?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb)

Note the gradient on the cars, unfortunately as I created the cars with an array I was not able to use objectID to randomise colour.

The I thought, you know what would look sick, a train, I like trains.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeJnL2BiXa4LDqGiPdyhEmLJa5ytlrjboAGPsWZ2uZ8QxtpaXOeRRx19r0LYYIe7bvj-tN-4CKmkSA_aMJgsYgIJV_a5Q_2V2PgV5y6IPk0dkRqDk7lHG5FHnbCkspzMx9gZoW-mw?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb)

I lined duplicated the project, moved the spline to weave between the mountains and added a train.

Apon rendering, however, something seemed off.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdLJPRJiflEEMjjtAb2izvWnzlJ_ErPbkyNnSOWkeUwAYWJLHCWODDGllclN9u12zta4Gabgv0bgxXBwSSoHGyGk_zjLez3YfGNiGQffWzojrDzEHpX1Bj8dlsN2I_Ys38bfkrdAg?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb)

I went into compositing and added some glare, some much needed color grading, and some soft focus

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdDpyNAL4BBIP0TWwlzly9u5yrn_fb8mKaKa4DQ6ywW1inDnKxBlUzBQcVl7i3v7FxNuJmXMoCFugT8ekQupSVDK-Vc7N0L19ENBOADQTTz6XCnvOKGsidVqU6xus1_O_rVro4bXg?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb)

And then I had another thought, this could be animated couldn’t it, an animated poster.

  

At this point, I rather annoyingly, got the flu, and two weeks where wasted, two weeks I had hoped to create the other two posters in, now I could have tried to create them in a day, and I did but the results were not pretty. Oh screw it here you go:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfOUH2mjp8laa5fJ8Rb1hZBGCUckkVHlWQAXZ9hPSWe21YQNbJCwLjtRrMJIEBZmiA31O9Y3qPfHj8m_MNH264Qh5nH3iEBTFuCSHSOsFBjmewf_G-qF8gB6QJRBtiOle5EaOSmrg?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb) 

  

Those tag lines are still an important thing to get across, so I had two options, have the captions all on the same poster. Or keep the poor designs and try to ignore the fact they look like what I stepped on coming up aylestone hill.

I spent quite a while trying to make the images look good with different design elements, and in my last bit of time before the project was over traced over one of the designed to create a vector graphic, now I had this:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcUoODDBCduDW-Ivkiq14uX5ygsAl8quwVKBa6aBJejRrdXC8RVgJKoK93tTSusfsDK_IomRFMIsomxueLXfOYqPBMA79dR7cII5JfIazx9ZhxYb4QDblOqoX9nUnS4kEBohCEn?key=QrxDZ6FKKMM9V78mkwVfMWNb)

Three posters. One that looks beautiful. One that looks fine, and one that looks like censored text with lots of swear words

And at this point, unfortunately, I ran out of time.
