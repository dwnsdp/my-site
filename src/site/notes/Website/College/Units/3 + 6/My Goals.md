Over this course so far I have enjoyed all aspects, I have enjoyed film making, editing, and blender. But the thing that links these all together and what I would like to focus on is the creative vision. I would like to in the future is freelance work in videography.

Working on my own means being the key role in production and working with a client to create a final product, I enjoy coming up with ideas and seeing them to fruition.

Working on your own means having a clear vision for what you want to create as well as working with the clients vision. Working with client can be challenging and means often working with a vision that is not your own, and not necessarily something you would be proud of yourself. Working with clients is definitely something I would struggle with and is something I would aim to work on.

- To be freelance has these requirements:
    
- Technical ability to create a final product
    
- Creative vision, ability to create an idea from the clients brief that they are happy with and you happy to create.
    
- Ability to professionally communicate with the client and agree on such things as budget, aims, deadlines. Be tolerant and understanding.
    
- Track the market and research what is currently popular, work with SEO and social media.
    

I aim to learn to communicate with a client, other industry professionals, and team members. I will do this over the course of my study. I would want to be more tolerable and work better with a team. I can do this by collaborating on set projects and by gaining experience by (aiming to) get jobs in the real world. Hopefully I will regularly be creating something with other people with who I can communicate.

Over this time span I also aim to improve my technical ability by gaining experience. Over the course I hopefully will improve my abilities and be able to create better products closer to the original aim.

Although I do not have a particular problem with time management I can aim to get better at it. Managing time is never a thing that can be perfected. Hopefully this will improve over the course on it's own.

## Skills needed

- Technical Ability
    
    - I am always learning to improve my technical ability with specific tools. I have multiple years of experience in blender and am currently learning premier pro. I can gain this experience simply by using the software more.
        
    - In terms of general technical ability I was a windows using for many years before switching to linux. Having spent a while in this world I feel I have a more detailed understand of both low level and high level than most
        
- Interpersonal Skills
    
    - My ability to communicate one to one is not a particular problem for me, all though it is always a thing to learn.
        
- Time Management
    
    - I have poor time management skills, though along the course of this course I have been improving, this is a thing to work on more if I wish to get into the industry. I tend to ignore schedules and work best under a strict crunch. My motivation depends on how invested I am in a project. And my time management depends on my motivation.
        
- Multitasking
    
    - As an avid tiling window manager user multitasking is my strength.
        
- Communication
    
    - I can comminicate well one to one though I struggle more with large groups of people. I have a difficult time understanding others points of views if they differ from mine and they do not explain eliquently. This is a weekness
        
- Physical Fitness
    
    - I think indeed.com just mentioned this to make it clearly a morbidly obese person cannot be a runner.
        
- Creativity
    
    - Creativity is not a weak point for me, if anything my problem is to many ideas which divert me from old project. This would not be a problem in proffesional work.
        

## Looking at someone else's path

Olivia Astrolago's career started as a passion, he spent years working on his technical skills.

He posted his work online on platforms such as vimeo and gained a following.

In around 2010 he got work with small brands, this helped him to gain an understanding of working with clients.

In 2014 and 206 he joined two creative/tech agencies based in London and Rome, which allowed him to work on larger projects and importantly allowed him to gain community connections.

His work reached a turning point when he recieved the vimeo staff pick in 2016. This boosted his views and landed him more jobs. In 2016 he made the video below.

I believe all negative boxes not to be at the fault of our own and therefore am happy with this result.

Blaming equipment is likely me making a joke about a socket being dirty and we definitelyf, 100%, asked the content creator what they thought.

I thought communication was high. If someone didn't speak it was likely because they didn't make an effort too.
