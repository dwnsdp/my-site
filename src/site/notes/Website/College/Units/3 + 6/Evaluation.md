## The Problem

In this project I created a series of posters to educate people about the negative impact of a car dependent country. Investment into public transit in the UK is shockingly low. If a town has a traffic issue the usual response from the council is to build more roads, as funding for transit is simply inadequate.

Building more roads is not a solution to traffic, induced demand means if a mode of transit is made better, more people will use it, if you build more roads more people will drive, and if you improve train times more people will take the train. But the problem is, cars, aside from planes, are the least efficient mode of transit, they take up an extreme amount of space, create air pollution, and are incredibly dangerous.

The only way to fix traffic is to build alternatives to driving and get people off the roads. This is beneficial to everyone, people with disabilities who need to drive will have emptier roads, people who like driving will not be stuck in traffic, and those who need to take transit will have a better time. I have a medical condition that means I cannot drive, I need transit, but the government puts significantly more money into cars than any other mode of transit.

Taking transit could be an incredibly comfortable experience, reading a book before work seems better to me than sitting behind the wheel in traffic, the only reason transit is not comfortable is the low investment from government agencies.

## What Can I do

First I created a style guide in Figma

I went with 1960s futurism as 1960s America was the home of propaganda promoting cars as the ideal mode of transit, payed for by oil companies. I want to create the same style but saying the opposite.

The colour palette was created by picking that first mauve colour and finding colours around it with a complementary colour wheel. These colors are often associated with the futurism movement, and their muted tones create a comforting feeling. The font is serifed and creates a feeling of nostalgia.

I did sketches of my poster designs in Photoshop. There were two posters:

1. A train moving at speed next to a traffic jam. The caption reads ‘Trains could be comfortable, clean, and safe. But the government spends 261% more on roads than rail’
    
2. A cross section of a traffic jam showing only one or two people in each car. The caption reads ‘Trains carry 50x more people than the average car leaving space for those who need to drive’
    

A lot of people are aware how polluting cars are, but they are not aware of the other problems and therefore think that the answer is the electric car. Both posters have a large tagline that reads ‘The answer is not the electric car’

This step, I reckon, is where things started to go wrong. The taglines, although good, barely portray the message I am trying to get across, and do not answer common beliefs about cars.

Opening blender I created a mass of nodes to create a shader that adapted to light and rendered in the style of my reference posters. I am quite confident with blender shaders and therefore this step went particularly well.

When making the first poster I had an idea to change road to be a train track. And it looked absolutely amazing, this was a third poster.

After I made the first poster I got flu and it left me with with significantly less time than I had planned for.

I tried to create the first poster again, but this time actually creating the concept I set out too.

On retrospection the main problem with it is the color grading. The models are fine but the black are too black and it is two desaturated. I don’t know if I would be able to color it well in future but I can certainly tell that it is graded poorly. I can confidently blame this on my lack of time left after the flu.

The final poster suffered from much the same problems.

  

In my last day of work I traced the second poster and I don’t think it looks too bad, If I saw it on the tube I would not double take. This artwork however in no way is similar to the designs I was trying to replicate. The posters I looked at tended to have that noisy texture and less clean line work. Therefore this poster does not have that nostalgic aesthetic.

## On Reflection

The flu caused significant delays, and it could be blamed for all my problems, but the bigger issue was the lack of contingency planning. I had a rigid plan for what I wanted to create, and did not allow myself, even if I should’ve, to change the plan when my timescale changed.

The reason the first poster went so well is I allowed myself to change the idea midway through, and have ideas throughout. This project revealed that I work best with flexible goals.

Another, almost larger problem with the project is the fact the taglines I created do not really portray the whole message I set out to portray. Use of short taglines is fine but not if they portray half the message, or worse, portray the message in such a way it can be looked at, and sniffed at, and passersby can simply come up with a reason they like cars which is not addressed on the poster in question.

I believe I used my tools to my advantage. I have a good knowledge of blender, especially shader nodes, and was able to create an aesthetic (at least for the first poster) that I liked. If anything I spent a little to much time working on the aesthetics rather than making that core messaging precise and clear.
