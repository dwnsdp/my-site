 have a medical condition that bars me from driving, however infrastructure in the UK means without a car you are basically screwed. The government knows this but continues to spend 261% more on roads than rail. Putting people in trains makes commutes safer, faster and more comfortable. It also leaves space on the roads for people who need or want to drive.

And no, the answer is not the electric car, electric cars don’t fix the problems, they are still space inefficient, dangerous, and bar teens, the elderly and those with certain disabilities like mine from mobility. Although less polluting than combustion they still have rolling noise and microplastic pollution that trains don’t have.

  

The idea is a to make a couple of posters showing how trains are the answer.

The aim of the project would be convincing people that driving is not the most efficient mode of transport and government subsidies should be moved into more efficient modes of transit.

  

Points to highlight:

- Less cars on road means less traffic for those who need to drive or those who enjoy driving (most people don't)
    
- Trains are more comfortable as you can not pay attention and work.
    
- Trains are faster
    
- Trains take up less space, Building more lanes just increases the amount of people who want to drive. 8 motorway lanes is equivalent to 1 train track
    
- People not using as many cars in cities means nicer spaces can be made
    
- If government subsidy was not in roads then trains would be much cheaper than driving. And with subsidy in trains they could be almost free
    
- If you live far from public transit that is not an argument for the car but an argument for improved public transit.
    

Poster ideas:

- Motorway with people taking up as much space as cars would
    

- Eight lane motorway next to a train track saying "space efficiency"
    

- Person drinking a coffee using a laptop looking out the window of a train at a traffic jam "electric cars are not the answer"
