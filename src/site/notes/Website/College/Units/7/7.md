## A History

There were choose your own adventure books. There were hundred of these, starting in the seventies and eighties. In these books you are given story of what your character does and must pick an option, for instance 'loot the body' or 'flee from the scene of the murder'. You would then go to the page corresponding with that choice where the consequences of your actions are given until your reach one of the endings.

The company behind these started making board games that worked a similar way. But at around the same time something a lot bigger happened. Dungeons and Dragons. Dungeons and Dragons is similar to a choose your own adventure book, but rather than the book telling you the consequences of your actions the Dungeon Master, another player, does. This means there are infinite choices, and also allows for such things as player stats that effect their route.

At some point early video games became a thing, these where very limited, like the books, but marked an important milestone. Video games have got better and better, and now a number of RPGs (role playing games) exist that have a number of ending based on the choices you make. My favorite example of this is the Stanley Parable, which is based on the idea that the dev's always know what choice the player wants to make. The game is incredibly meta and spites the player for being predictable.

There is also another genre of video games where you choose your own adventure; interactive television. Where you pick choices and preset videos play. Almost exactly like choose your own adventure books but rather than writing it is acting. These all pretty much immediately flopped. Except for a couple of animated ones made by the company 'Telltale Games'

1974 - D&D is released an RPG where another person, the DM, decides the consequences of your actions.

1975 - The dungeons comes out, a very limited dungeon crawler

1979 - The first choose your own adventure book is released

1983 - Dragons Lair is released which 'featured animated sequences where players made timed decisions to progress'

1993 - Myst is released. A choose your own adventure game with pre-rendered enviroments

1994 - The first Elder Scrolls came out, the beginning of a series many consider to be the backbone of RPGs

2015 - Minecraft Story Mode comes out. One of the first popular choose your own adventure's with pre animated scenes.

2018 - Black Mirror Bauldersnatch - The start of Netflix' obsession with poorly implemented choose your own adventures

2019 - AI Dungeons - A game showcasing how AI can replace the role of the DM in D&D

## Stornaway not to be confused with Stornoway

We are going to be making a choose your own adventure with Stornaway. So let's learn about that. Stornaway is based on graphs and can be used to link videos together by asking a question. Much in the same way that you choose in a choose your adventure book.

Stornaway has been used for low budget videos by students as well as massive triple A titles like [The Gallery](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1884570/The_Gallery/). The Gallery got mixed reviews, however. I don't think there has been a massive choose your own adventure game since tell tale games was massive.

It can be used for story telling, which is, I think, where it shines best, or it can be used for quizzes. Exploring spaces. etc.

Unfortunately you can only create 25 nodes. Which is an incredibly tight restriction. For this reason if not on this course I would not even consider this software. But for the purpose of this project I look forward to working with this software.

## What is interactive media? 

 I think to answer that we need to look at what the words mean on there own.

Interactive is defined in the dictionary is “things that influence each other”, for instance a player influencing gameplayer. When you sit down to watch a film you do not influence the film. When you play a video game you do. But of course there will always be gray areas. If you watch a video and you look around are you interacting. Is the direction you look influencing the video. I argue no, because no matter how your perspective changes the video goes on the same. Interactivity can be defined by wether or not your actions influence the media.

What about media. How do we define media. This is a lot more difficult to define. We can come up with things that are media, a film, a book, a blog. And we can come up with things that are not media. But where do we draw the line.

The anecdote I like to go to for this is fruits. There is no proper definition of fruit. We have the botanical definition, sure, but that makes things that aren’t fruits fruits and vice versa. Categorisation is subjective, dictionary definitions do not tell the full story. We have had fruit as a category of things long before the victorians decided things needed strict definitions, and homogenised language, often making things more complicated (blame them for our weird spelling). 

The Prototypical theory states that people think of categories not but strict definitions but by the similarity to a prototype. For "berry," we might think of small, round, sweet fruits like strawberries or blueberries as the prototypical examples. In essence prototypical theory states that categories are not black and white but defined on the principle of similarity, a property with infinite gray values.

I will die on the hill that a tomato is not a fruit.

The dictionary definition for media is ‘mass communication’ But of course as this is a hard categorization it has things that I would disagree with. A PA system is surely not media.

Interactive media is not definable. Interactive is, media is not.

## Virtual Reality

We went to a VR experience to test out an alternative mode of interactive media. So here is what it did wrong, and right, from the perspective of someone with no depth perception.

I felt much more immersed than a traditional video game, as despite not having the main selling point of VR what it did still have was gyroscopically controlled view and controls with my hands in 3D space. I spent most of the time, however, failing  at games as in VR I am lacking the context clues I would normally have in the real world. You see without depth perception I am forced to go to other methods to work out where things are. The way the shadows fall, how fast it is moving, and most importantly, my preconceptions as to how large an object ought be. VR lacks all of this as it focusses on the illusion on depth with a stereoscopic image which no other medium has. This made some games hard, and some games, such as beat sabre, nigh on impossible.

At the place we went they also had something else, a motion rig so you feel you are really moving. This was exceptionally cool, and if they did not cost multiple grand I would own at least one of them. The medium used a sense no other video game could, which was... cool.

## A Bad Example

We looked at the interactive Netflix series "you vs wild out cold" featuring bear grills to see what it did well, and what could be improved.

  

The main thing that was clearly lacking was the fact only one path worked. The main benefit of interactivity is the fact you control the path. This series you feel like you do not control the path. The acting was also atrocious. The show seemed to be aiming to be educational but the only the thing it taught was the correct path to make.

## A Good Example

Okay, in my subjective opinion this is not a good example, but it did rate very highly and most people seem to like it.

Minecraft Story mode is a spin off of Minecraft where you choose what the character Jessie does as she / he (note the ambiguous name) defends the overworld against hackers.

Unfortunately it has a problem that I think plagues all CYOA games in that it is hard to make your choice meaningful, generally when you made a choice that  and it the end it is just a bad film

Early choose your own adventure books are fantastic because we did not have video games, but now we do there is no room for choose your own adventure as a medium. Games are interactive, and films are for relaxing to.

## Horror

Our project will be horror, so let's research the genre. We watched a film in called the Babadook to see what it did right… and wrong.

The Babadook (2014) is a horror film that uses a monster as an anecdote to the grief experienced by a widow. 

The sound design is undoubtedly one of the film's highlights.

The Babadook uses background noises and low-frequency sounds that mimic heartbeats rather than music to create a tense atmosphere. They highlight every day sounds rather than adding music and using silent props, making the horror feel more grounded and visceral. The film hasshaky, sometimes out-of-focus shots creating an unsettling feeling which makes the film feel unstable and challenging to watch. The slight frame rate drops, if not caused by the laptop we watched it on, seem to add to the discomfort, making it feel as though the viewer is experiencing the story through a distorted lens.

The problem comes with the fact the filmmakers did not seem to know what and what not they were capable of. The reveal of the Babadook lacks the fear factor because the creature's design is clearly just a dude, possibly due to budget constraints or limited experience with CGI and makeup. The monster appearing doesn't land as horrifying but rather it's laughable, with some poorly executed effects that detract from the tension. The film could have been significantly more effective if they had instead never shown the monster.

The film also struggles with pacing and writing. While the first half is entirely building tension, the resolution feels almost disappointing. The monster is no longer a threat once the characters accept their grief, but the tension evaporates. Some character choices and plot points are left unresolved, such as the abrupt disappearance of a supporting character with no explanation.

I feel I really could have liked this film, but it loses much of its impact due to weak visual effects and some awkward storytelling choices.

## Production Log
Having had the will o’ the wisp story being chosen, I reckon I should start creating the story in stornoway.

In my story, the protagonist experiences every possible timeline, as explained by a narrator. Each path represents a different outcome, but they all lead back to him in the current timeline. The will-o’-the-wisp is the soul of the versions of him that died, visible only in the timelines where he survives—where he tells the story.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXelkUUunwxYmQoXprxXNnxFqrhy_maKpMRDepx6G-uoHohV9D1QGPHbMCnPqEzNXbohk6GtHLLh16H0qiyp6TO8F5K28Y25q2gjABBc8-8Wf437ZXzVXMRPpJ-Q5MXqvVPKvgGY?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

When I finished making the story, I gave a few play tests. It seemed to work quite well. I then just went through each island and came up with a shot idea that seemed relevant and I could easily make / reuse. In the end my shots were:

- Looking out carriage window seeing faint shimmer
    
- Looking at shimmer through binos
    
- Man walks toward shimmer
    
- Hand touches wisp
    
- Shot of marsh panning up to sky
    
- Man talking in pub
    

It's quite hard to create a nice scene in blender with the illustrated style I was going for. I was initially trying to use shader to RGB with a color ramp so I could take a shaded surface and give it set colors for brightnesses. Tomorrow I will try to add some painterly dithering to make it better. But my main problem is that using color ramps your color theory needs to be on point.

I just spent some time created a water color shader that takes a singular color input to make the coloring easier.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfiYs6BMDee6qIHnmh-GkA2XSb4SIGHLnpNwWnZYBWaTdirUXn9v5fIev_eDnwAFK0nZorWGlnzccs9aYgsOCeYMr5mHhn9OweFEnbmVRBiRJDQHAspgAEI5DSzubRwXMb0j4vA?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

I really like the way this looks except for the black that is being created.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfVYKpew39EgFvyH23-KZ_ubNGVMoYiQyOhXkVh_CA6gA5z-i5Il8NfV0I2fiN-odHVQsP4-qA5bciqE_jB2sWN5Ki_PorDElrHQSnrOfZjeeO6NKeq4oTSro_SiYvxfKz95PbbDg?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

If you look in eevee you can see how it is supposed to look.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeg060rhiDpaLf1kQ72tsFmUx3q6KH0ufaY_g3q51-zEhfcsjdyyNS2V9HuJ1c39OSLwq_3ZmxzI2EI3R7ak4imPyEhTgCNA522M7hLVJ2J4fTREAt7Hdw_o2mTX50f1vsBExF_yQ?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

Basically the shader separates the vector to RGB so there are single channel values to mess with. Then for each of them in posterizes them to 2 bits using a brush stroke texture as a dithering pattern.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe45tPf8POsMLIDZ4vAzHgiAqw0M02iHVb5adTWJBIOUZ0Gh_iRopUf30pTHp-q5obojwsR3Unk74wPgNHeA2oU9JMh8sqMlJVwyAaLgr9aSO1gzS0srh-kCUGRTwsdfB3UoQKGgA?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)  
It is in a node group so I can reuse it. But right now I am focused on removing that black from cycles.

My suspicion is that the vectors are being added up to an invalid value

I basically just scrapped everything I’d been working on for the past few days, but I think it was worth it. Instead of using a watercolor shader in Blender, I’m painting in Photoshop with a watercolor style, then layering those paintings in Blender to create a parallax effect, I can generate normals and light the images to create a water color look with 3D. This method should give me more control over the scene than using meshes.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcYMw1ZOVabW2asfz4iRFU3YOW-vDCG4YhnRplWyhrEbd9Js1PvPfdCGSQ7_QUXfoXDGjbaODMQt1G_O8741ZYM0Q4cnmQtEXlFRdiYZ3nyxiNWtFCsNNcC2UnMBWCX7h0SK3wz?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

The scene is created from a few images; a horse and cart, terrain, which is layered backwards on image planes using an array.

  

The scene also has a the will o’ the wisp itself which I have been learning geonodes to create.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcYiviA4yUBqYukQ1ZgbrI-ULzlW_1HqRwf_xbGczp78Gq2cmh7YJ0yAwX-C_1ajAzrzRYTXRejA9SrG9o2sBEaJQyixMnYKeTCQZn8-_5YwTlPc5WLdTjv1MqjQmTGjWaDqxg6Xg?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

I have put all of the assets into a group and hidden them by default so I can create different scenes in groups and simply hide all the ones I am not using. The assets are all linked so if I change them they change in the scenes.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcBnPD238B_v8R_KiFT2FTnVr1MDVF8eDhQIr2rG31tNfbPH7oV_jJ1xvfyxmIXMQocX6ezJV4qcgNiKv2T1zjFblRlYXZ0Zs6OP47Lc7xZoGIGZEaXovT2JmHpfL_RWSedK9i9xw?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

That purple is the wheel, the blue is the carriage, and the green is the terrain. If you can see that little black dot the camera ends up looking at, that is the wisp.

At this point I just needed to crack on creating the other scenes.

For the next scene I needed the character in silhouette looking out over the marsh. So I simply traced an image in photoshop and added him looking at the wisp. These stills are starting to look good

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfKB4j42oIjP4jniqpsRRP-pNdU8PE0ZAFvv9kCLsxCXBtehqc7EW-ePSrE3_LLsCQpJgnG8vy6EcK0saUXdGdvUfVQFGqUfhu5_9iB6VWpov6bJenT9CdJ06brFu5RaKE9zj1fDg?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

You may have noticed the mountains. I found an addon that generates these and all I really had to do is add->mountains

  

I love the composition but my color theory is just off

So I pop into compositing and add some curves.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXduT-hKFMNYAc2afNBbxf8wqsBhqAFplyjQbEg4CQPU_5Fq9zZ4jsSmzlzdg-lk1EhJb6U9HhTM0HS0bSW43CimWBG2S52SJ6i425ng9D4UKBUrXp5hrbUhXDxnG-LlwJ6Rp70nYw?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

I still am not really happy with it though. Normally if I do not like a scene I just add noise. But I have had a different idea. Adding a threshold with noise for dithering to create an old fashioned look.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdm8q4tbju16IVsB3jSSYNQrDYUkEKCZjs5mQSOTERkhM5ydOvx0IKIJbppuo4UxDJmOcrb_5MqnEmKqtHxtfi_YhVeMf-3H9L_LMWpVbLSTgakEKKwv6Q8dAYZLb6nN9YQqpObzw?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

But why waste time rending nice crisp images then adding noise when I can just not do much raytracing, not denoise it, and call that the noise

> NOTE FROM FUTURE JAKE. THIS IS WHERE THINGS STARTED GOING DOWN HILL, WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE AT THIS POINT IS DOWNED THE RENDER COUNT BUT STILL DENOISED IT AND ADDED MY OWN NOISE

So I downed the render count and used that noise, it looked almost as good!

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfELhtXPDivtSg0Da3caNOVX4TDHqGqfGkw07EC_rBbL_wsh8xYi8eaNSi1DENTggRA1_9YbMFwfgoYmK6Z6JrS1o4bWpawb3I7WF6pxy5t0dpus3QXixirjjL70D2Zs8ShR9qx?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

THIS DOES NOT LOOK ANYWHERE NEAR AS GOOD I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS ON ABOUT, AND SEE THAT LINE DOWN THE MIDDLE? AS IT TURNS OUT THE NOISE IN CYCLES IS BASED PARTIALLY ON FACE NORMALS, MEANING THE PLANES I AM USING STICK OUT LIKE A SAW THUMB, UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT NOTICE THIS UNTIL AFTER I HAD RENDERED IT, AT WHICH POINT IT BECAME PAINFULLY VISIBLE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE

This was originally going to be just looking through binoculars but I felt adding something to the foreground makes the scene more aesthetic. The animation pulls the focus from starting on the man and moving slowly to the wisp, this looks spectacular

So I moved on to the next scene, the man telling his tale in the pub.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfqp-qOTvAuSHsdYqdPOgzvUhTNwyCRRYXQL4eWKocbm86oMzCOK4VnhMcMM91IiS6ervUOpbQVVdAtnpVxeoj9HZfwFlHDDBinIV4htVxoc_oNJmRYfnArp4Dntjv_LnWukoYWCw?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

And I made the man walking up to the wisp, which is basically the close up but with the man animated to move towards it and going up and down.

I made a hand reaching out to touch it, with an image I drew of a hand.

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd4MXJFY_BdQ1P25ge-ZIf5KS-vEs0GuTIVbjrrHWUH96tE-v59L890RwByea_5WUVo0-tZufMPOZ68XYED2lZYgf2LkspM_vXJ7VDOJj1AcTNj0NsMJ0ZNlGjz8W4lum5mCvMuvQ?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

This kinda doesn’t look that good as the wisp is far too bright. But I am not really sure what is to be done about that fact so I shall just have to bear with the result.

I also made a shot of the camera panning from the bog up to the mountains as b-roll for the bits I could not do a render for

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeeBZu2kfl_bbvA-5skRuS6E-AIHo2H50ZGO0HoKRXw9T_J2E9J4D0pdcU0zOKtWGH6lA1_kzWj07_aJ341b4EQ1Oeicx5srkczOFBxZnQ0pPqa5QLikuP-x7Oks0BlslCmKei7qQ?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdBZ3_qxBkq6rSgvQph1AMzXc2I6a1gCdYIXseab70kIIY8WlibLYShwxj-R_tzLpP5AS2FGJ_b09Q3TAbQlPyTC_IHA3kDKzy_Rdy0FCPeOxsoMgUTW6myFGOrCvAc4l_OlbNn?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

OUT OF CURIOSITY I HAVE JUST MADE REDONE THE MOUNTAIN RENDER WITH THE NICER NOISE ADDED IN POST

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcFEFzinxIFE6rf4zhEKSUy5pPr7I9J8NYZOQhHS_Rdy6IAD29GzIwO9o4UX4xQAe26TYYJsBJYT8S0tsK7mCghX3KiZBKDieq0HHnui45HkHF-6nbe-cMc5WVUOHVSf0Ehe6kDuw?key=v3nMLayX2FGgDptKPK5u1kZd)

AS EXPECTED, MUCH NICER.

And then it was time to render. I cached all of the assets, went to a more powerful computer and hit render.

  

I rendered the animations as PNG sequences and put them into premier pro using the import image sequence option.

I created a piece on the piano for a backing track:

- Cm7
    
- Cm7 with the 7 down an octave
    
- Abm
    
- Gm (G being the 5th of Cm to create a loop)
    

The melody, if one can call it that is just G G Ab G G Ab GG etc.

The chords start static and then arpeggiate.

In premier I put in the music, having recorded the piano with my phone. And choose parts that worked with the subject matter.

For the most part the shots I had created were applied to one island, one video clip for one island, though in one case I cut between two. However the shots I ended up with did not entirely match my shot list due to mainly artistic ideas I only came up with later.

- Looking out carriage window seeing faint shimmer -> Shot of carriage moving past camera. Behind it is the wisp.
    
- Looking at shimmer through binos -> The man looking at the wisp. The shot has a shallow depth of field which switches from him to the wisp.
    
- Man walks toward shimmer -> Remained unchanged
    
- Hand touches wisp -> Remained unchanged
    
- Shot of marsh panning up to sky -> The shot now pans up to the mountains instead
    
- Man talking in pub -> He is in silhouette so I did not have to animate talking
    

The voice over was simply me reading off the lines from my storyboard into a zoom mic, and then, losing the SD card and rerecording it into my phone.

I then exported the different parts using mark in and out and added them to stornoway, no problems here!

## Evaluation

I started the project with research, two methods of research. I started by simply reading about choose your own adventurers. This help me gain a better understanding of the history, and I certainly need to do this for future projects. But what helped more was playing some choose your adventure games, watching some horror filmings, and using alternative mediums such as VR. This helped me understand what the medium could and could not do. When you make a TV show, for instance, you must watch the TV so you can understand what you do and do not like. This helped me with my idea generation as I could understand what was and was not a good idea. Though my following of my own research did not neccesarily go to well. Which you will find out about later.

Research went swimmingly for idea generation. I already had a myth which was peaking my interest and I enjoyed finding obscure old blogs with rural people explaining their experience, though it did slightly sadden me that this is a thing that we cannot have any more. My research did, admittedly focus on one idea rather than coming up with a particular range that I could select from. The others came as a sort of after thought. I ought in the future research multiple ideas.

I started off working on a water color shader, I wanted to create an old fashioned, stylised, and moving aesthetic. This is something I had done quite a lot in the past and I was thinking I would like to stick with what I knew. I spent a good few days creating it before scrapping it as it was not working how I wanted it too, though overall I think this was a positive although it wasted my time as it forced me to do a different style, something I had not done before.

So let’s get on to the images, having decided the water color shader was not for me I instead decided to do something I had never done before, use images layered in blender with normals to create lighting. This was originally derived from me drawing the background as a separate image before realising that this could surely be done for the foreground as well. I created normals to help deflect the light, so for instance the ground can have the light of the wisp bounce off of it in an interesting way to cast shadows. The images are simply on planes with an alpha map.

I traced most of the images in photoshop to make up for my lack of skills, though I shall not call this a problem as the results are good and I did not set out to improve my drawing. I am quite happy with this idea. Though it does have it's flaws. A rather major one being the inability to do proper animation. Throughout the game images move but that is almost it. The wheel spinning was the most ambitious animation that I did. This does, admitedly, look slightly strange as the horse slides along the ground. If I were to do this again I could create 2D animations for the planes, for instance the horse galloping, the carriage bobbing up and down.

Unfortunately my color theory is not the best in the world, and in the end I went with the quitters approach and made it black and white, for what I will call artistic intent.

But what goes better with black and white than some film grain, this was such a good idea, I posterised the image to be black and white, adding some film grain to dither the image first. But then, I had a thought, it was a bad thought. What If I were to use cycles noise and disguise it as my own cooking. I will never make this mistake again. Cycles noise has a number of problems, obvious patterns in noise, noise not changing between frames, and more importantly the noise is based on normals which means that you can see the rectangles of the images I used.

And I failed, importantly, to catch this error until I had rendered everything and the deadline was near. I had only been testing stills and therefore did not notice the flaws.

But overall I really like the look as it fits more into that old fashioned look than I think water colors ever could have, and with less work too as I did not have to create meshes but rather just draw 2D images.

But I had a much more core issue, the story telling itself kinda sucks. I fell into the trap that all of the other games I looked at as research fell into. The story is not truly interactive. And I could, and probably should put myself to blame for this, but looking back at that research I come to a realisation.

Early choose your own adventure books are fantastic because we did not have video games, but now we do there is no room for choose your own adventure as a medium. Games are interactive, and film is for relaxing to.

I wrote a story and recorded it. The writing sounds like a small white child went to summer creative writing camp and now sends poetry to their crushes, and the voice acting is a testament to my lack of skill, but I was luckily able to disguise both these things with music I am proud of recording and visuals that despite the flaws still look fantastic.

The music is a simple progression in Cm slightly arpeggiated. It is designed to sound as good as possible with as little brain power as possible.

I am proud of myself that in every project I do I follow the same path, I create something awful, I make many fatal mistakes, and somehow, in the last few days, manage to turn it into something I am proud of. I learnt new techniques, learnt never again to use cycles noise, to test the animations, and have decided I should probably not rely on my phone mic for voice overs.

So, overall, I am happy with the results, the results in the images themselves, and the results in what I have learnt.

The style of layered images, though I did not implement it particularly well, is certainly something I want up my arsenal.
