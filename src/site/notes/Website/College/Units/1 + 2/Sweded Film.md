## The Kingsman

### My Idea:

My idea is that we create this scene from the Kingsman, as it is one of my favourite scenes from any film and I instantly thought of it when asked for a scene we could recreate. All elements of the scene would be possible but within the scope of being hard enough to make it a project that can be learnt from. The scene is filled with humour and creative techniques could be used to merge scenes that are shot with hot wheels and with real scale humans. Filming with hot wheels could be an experience that all of us could learn from. Unfortunately this idea was voted out by my teams and instead we did:

## Evaluation

We decided to recreate [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxL8bVJhXCM) featuring darth vader from the end of rogue one in a sweded style.

We first created a plan of the props that we would need and wrote a risk assessment using the colleges default form to make sure what we were doing was safe. Darth Vader was easy to make as someone had a helmet and someone else, a light sabre. The troopers where just people in bike helmets, the card machine as piece of cardboard with a slot cut in it, the card itself a student ID and the beginning and opening shots simply drawing on a piece of paper.

We then went through the shots, in no particular order ticking items off a list, and attempted to recreate them. I was on the camera and having a great time. As I did not have a tripod or anything fancy we results to some peculiar measures as I used an office chair as a dolly, speeding down the corridor. People seemed to enjoy infiltrating our set, but for the most part when actually filming the process was quite easy. For the final shot we needed to be outside and as such had to walk through college with Darth and a lightsaber. As one stranger put it; "what the f**k is wrong with you"

Once we had the clips I started cutting them loosely together in premier, using the original clip is reference. Although I don't have much experience in the program this was relatively easy and after a *cinematic* colour grade we had done the video.

But we didn't have any audio yet. We recorded most of the sounds in a quite room in college but at some point we needed more and the room was occupied. Fortunately lifts are very noise insulated and sound dampening. We recorded all of the music and audio after the fact (including dialogue as the actually filming location was to loud) and after I had lined it up in premier we got this *beautiful* final result.

The most difficult part of this project was attempting to organise and motivate the actors. We likely could have finished much more quickly if we had a committed team.

If we were to do this project again with a longer time period we would have been more careful about accuracy. We probably would have found locations that more closely represented the scenes. However I feel that making the project too accurate would probably remove some of the watchability. If the film was a perfect recreation there would be no need to recreate and it would lose itâ€™s humour. I we could do this project again with a longer time period not a lot would have realistically changed. We may have filmed with better equipment but the charm and rushed feeling would still need to be there.
