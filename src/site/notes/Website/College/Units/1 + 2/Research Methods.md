## Primary Research

Primary research is research done by the first party

Primary research is often slower and requires more effort but comes straight from the sources so you have control of the quality. It is also free of plagiarism so safe to use in academic work.

Primary research is useful for when that research has not been done before or when you need to know the source. Primary research is also useful for academic work as you cannot be penalised for plagiarism.
## Secondary Research

Secondary research is research done by a third party

Secondary research is fast and accessible but comes via a third party so you do not have control over the quality. Secondary research can be biased and use in academic work is not recommended as plagiarism can become a problem.

Secondary research is useful as evidence of primary research or for when enough research exists that you can be sure of accuracy

## Quantitative

Quantitative research is numerical or based on fixed datapoints.

Quantitative research is often objective and factual with less room for bias. However it can give less depth to results as data is not explained.

Qualitative research is useful for data based research with an existing scale and little room for interpretation. However they are not useful for subjects that require opinion or non fact based data.

## Qualitative

Qualitative research is written and based on observation

Qualitative research is subjective with depth to results as data is explained. But has room inaccuracy as results can be cherry picked and speculated apon based on pre-existing bias.

Qualitative research is useful for opinion surveys and market research as more detail can be taken. However qualitative research is not useful for data based subjects without room for interpretation.

## Internet

The internet a protocol for sharing of digital information

The internet is up to date and easy to access but can have [limited factuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_of_Wikipedia) as research is often not verified. This makes it a great source for quick research but makes it difficult to use in situtations where information must be verified

## Books

Books are information published in detail on paper

Books are highly factually as they go through an elaborate verification process passing through multiple editors and publishers. But once a book is published it cannot be changed meaning books are often outdated.

Books are useful for when you cannot find a reliable source on the internet of in magazines.

## Magazines

Magazines are less detailed than books but new issues are released regularly.

Magazines are normally factual as they are verified (though less than books), and they are updated regularly meaning the information is less out of date than books but more than the internet.

Magazines are a very valuable source of information as they share the pros of both books and the internet
