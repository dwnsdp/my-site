## Maya

Made by [Autodesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk); Maya is the industry standard for large companies and it has been around since the nineties.Â  Maya was originally just used for cinema. And as such also contains an advanced rendering engine. However Maya is not used for smaller companies or individuals as it is excessively priced. As Autodesk has purchased the market Maya has been on a downturn.

Made in Blender, just now, by, me. (Primary Research)

## Blender

Blender is a holistic open source software made by the community. Blender has become an standard for modelling and animation. But this is not all it offers. Blender has three advanced render engines, (if you count workbench), video editing, compositing and at one point it even contained a full game engine.

Blender is used mainly by individuals or small companies as although it is powerful and free the open source nature means that it does not have the reliability that triple A companies rely on.

## 3DS Max

3DS max is once again a prohibitively expensive software made mainly for big budget companies. 3DS max has the largest market share allthough most of that is it being used as CAD software rather than in AAA settings. Peculiarly 3ds max is made by the same people as Maya, [Autodesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk). Autodesk has a massive monopoly in the 3D space as they buy out all of their competitors. As of 2024 Autodesk has made 58 acquisitions, most of which would have been competitors.

## "Which of these had you heard of before starting the course"

Acknowledging bias: This dataset it taken from a class doing digital media, and there for the chance that a person has heard of this software is warped severely.
