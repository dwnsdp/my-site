Research

Researching podcasts went relatively well for me. We were asked to listen to three podcasts and work out what makes them tick. I definitely feel I have the upper hand in this task as I already listen to about two hours of podcast everyday on the way to college, though normally these are less entertainment and more informational.

We were also tasked by our fantastic amazing youthful tutor to add foley to a clip with the audio removed from an Attenborough film. This was so that we could betterÂ  understand the process of audio production.

I got along swimmingly with this topic as I have a bit of a history with music production and DAWs. We were told to record all sounds ourselves we did this in the lift as it came out to be a perfectly quite place to record audio, though it did result in a few clips of lift going up as people pressed the buttons. This was where my only real problem with the research stage came into play. I under estimated the amount of sounds we would need and missed some key ones whilst we still had a quiet place to record. As such a few of the sounds were recorded in a loud environment. I did take not of all sounds that were required but those that were required to go on, like wind for instance, were not long enough.

Overall I did not have any major problems with the research stage and it set me up well to produce a podcast.

Preproduction

Preproduction was relatively easy. We were tasked with planning our time and I although I planned inaccurately, all's well that ends well.

We simply filled in a production schedule for the coming week with time, equipment, personnel.

I definitely under estimated the amount of time it would take to do some tasks but we will get to how it went once I get into the production itself.

In this time I also came up with some basic questions to ask my guest with the plan to mainly just come up with them on the spot to improve the flow of the 'cast.

Hopefully this means that in future projects this experience will teach me to be more slow with my planning, although to avoid lying I do enjoy completely winging it.

Production

Production was where all of the set backs happened for my podcast.

We had planned for the recording to take about an hour, and it did, but unfortunately the microphone was picking up loud electromagnetic interference from a phone placed a little to close.

So we moved the phone and donned some IEMs. No problemo.

On the second try the recording quality was *perfect*. 'pon listening back, however, we discovered a much larger problem, if you have ever heard the stereotype of white guys doing a podcast, that was us.

Neither of us had put much effort into sounding engaging and it really showed. We also spoke strangely formally and it gave the podcast a weird vibe.

On the third try we got it down, we recorded for about twenty five minutes, there was a lot of waffle that had to be cut out but the take was good and we were happy with it. The take was mostly this long as we planned our next questions and such whilst recording.

My idea of asking questions worked surprisingly well as I was able to make the questions run off previous answers, making the interview flow more like a natural conversation.

Postproduction

Post production went very well and I made good time of it.

I edited in audition and that twenty five minutes was whittled down to five minutes with few mistakes. Us recording for so long in the end was a very jolly good thing as it meant I had a plethora of material to pick from. If someone stuttered over a sentence it was sure that they said it again at some point.

A jingle was made for the beginning with a GAN called Suno, the jingle sounds quite good but if I had been a little less lazy I may have created one myself rather than using the GAN. Fun fact by the way. I was in the Discord server where Suno was originally hosted back when it was called songbird when there were less than 100 people.

In the end

This topic went well only being hindered by poor time management skills. Which could very much have been a problem if we had not had so much time. But a full week this problem did not really come to fruition as the schedule had planned for some empty days at the end.
