Films & TV: The US Military has a bit of history of funding films if they feel that the film will influence the population to be in favour of wars and even enscript. This problem is not only in the US though. The BBC who as well as news produce TV programs have many times in the past been accused of being funded by the government, though it is not clear how true this is.

Games: Since the nineteen seventies people have been making combat games that embellish war^1 These games more often that not turn shooting into a fun activity with clear cut 'bad guys' and no feeling of ethical wrongness. And a lot of the time the guys you are shooting are people that Americans already have a bias against, for instance in COD Modern Warfare you play as an American in Russia gunning down Arabs^5 These are produced by American teams who often have heavy bias. These game are designed to bias citizens further against countries that America already dislike.

Social Media: Traditional media is not the only sort that can be used a propaganda. Youtube and TikTok vlogs can be 'sponsored' (paid for) by companies, but they can also be sponsored by government. The US navy's out reach programme includes paying influencers to make the military seem like a fun, team building, travelling the world activity, completely ignoring the danger. This is clearly propaganda, a way to influence citizens.

The Russian government is thought to own bots on some social media sites that boost content in favour of the russian government

Books: The Soviets somewhat famously used existing books and rewrote them into stories that showed Russia in a good light. This is a stronger example than the Americans and shows how propaganda, even if obvious in hind sight is so hard to notice.

"ALL ART is propaganda, but not all propaganda is art.”  - Orwell

### People seem to like propaganda?

It is relatively common knowledge that war films tend to be propaganda yet people still watch them, why? Well it comes down to the fact people still enjoy watching this genre of films as entertainment, no one really wants to watch a film that makes war out as it is, because as it is is miserable. People have come to prefer this version of action. When other races are portrayed negatively this is fine, this is a writing device so less thought has to be put into understanding character traits. But the negative effect of this is not widely understood, these stereotypes are believed to be true in the real world and this only propagates it. Convincing people to join the army as a herioc act. 

Propaganda in entertainment works so well as the audience is expecting entertainment and as such does not consider fact as much, information soaks in and no one knows their beliefs are being altered.

### In the past

Propaganda has always been a massive part of war efforts. In world war two every country created thousands of designs rallying troups and those on the home front.

Keep come and carry on
