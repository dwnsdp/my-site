# Lets take a look at three very different podcasts

## Times Daily Briefing

Is a very short (around eight minutes) podcast released thrice daily to keep you up to date on news.

Monetization: This podcast has more ad than news. These adverts are very generic and do not generally relate that much to the podcast.

Audio: The podcast is simple; only the narrator

Structure: The podcast starts with generic ads. They quickly go through the news in a similar fashion to how the BBC does the news on the radio and it ends with more ads.

Tone: The podcast is serious and straight, there is not complexity, humour, or sign of emotion.

## The Climate Denier's Playbook

Is a podcast about climate change, in every episode they take apart a common misconception or belief

Structure: The podcast starts with two hosts, a women and a man. The women makes an untrue point / misconception that is commonly made before the intro music roles along with a supercut of people who have this opinion. The hosts then have a discussion about this opinion, the man being an expert who is semi-scripted, in the middle there is an ad break.

Audio: No sounds are used except for the intro music and the narrators. Sometimes whilst they are talking they play audio clips from news shows or such that they wish to talk about

Tone: The podcast although about a serious topic the podcast is in a very jovial tone with jokes.

Monetization: This podcast is monetised by an ad for their Patreon account. The advert is fun and related to the podcasts subject, often feeling more integrated than a basic ad read would do.

## The Decoder

In this podcast the verge interviews CEOs and people high up at (normally) tech companies

Monetization: This podcast starts and ends with sponsored ad readings by the host of the podcast. The adverts are generally at least vaguely related to the podcasts subject.

Structure: After the opening ads the host talks about the person they are going to interview and the idea the thing they will discuss, this section is normally only ten minutes and tells you everything you need to know about the topic, but nothing of the interviewees opinion. They play the intro and start the interview with a break half way through, for them, not for us.

Audio: There is light electronic background music throughout the intro before the main interview starts when it ends. This is appropriate as topics are often about technology.

Tone: The host is playful whilst being respecting of the interviewee, they occasionally make jokes and the interviewee forces a laugh.

# What can we learn from this

Podcasts are a relatively easy way to share thoughts on a matter without the hassle of forms like written media or vlogging. They are easy to consume as you can listen to them whilst doing other things, on any device capable of playing MP3s, this is not the only thing that makes them so great. Podcasts come in a massive range of shapes and sizes. As something that any one can do it ranges from guy at home with a microphone, no equipment or skills just a guy at 4am talking about pigeons like the [blind boy podcast](https://shows.acast.com/blindboy) or a produced show by a large media company like the decoder, with adverts and production and everything.

[As of June 2024, there are at least 3,369,942 podcasts and 199,483,500 episodes  
](https://www.listennotes.com/podcast-stats/)fun fact this means the average podcast has 59 episodes

# What even is a podcast though

"a radio programme that is stored in a digital form that you can download from the internet..."

# Podcasts are expression for the masses

Podcasts are cheap and easy to make for every one, you do not need specialised equipment or skills and unlike blogs or other written media you don't even really need literacy, you just speak your mind as you would to a friend. This explains the three-odd-million podcasts in the world. Chances are the the majority of people do not listen to these however, Bob the retired Plumber has no way of pushing his podcast onto people like with a social media post but people make them anyway, even if you are throwing your expression into the void you are still expressing yourself.

# The History

In late 90s the internet was relatively new and people were working out what it was capable of. RSS was already a thing and some one had an idea, audio over RSS, a radio program on demand. People started putting them on MP3 players, the most popular being the iPod with iPodderX.

In 2004 Ben Hammersley , a guardian columnist reporting on this said one sentence, which he later told the verge was thought up on the spot to reach a deadline:

[But what to call it? Audioblogging? Podcasting? GuerillaMedia?](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/feb/12/broadcasting.digitalmedia)Â 

In 2007 Apple added a feature to iTunes to make downloading RSS audio to the iPod easy. Steve Jobs having read this article called it Podcasting and the term stuck.

# Target Audience

Creating a target audience is a way of catering your product to a certain genre of people. For instance a book may be written and targetted towards women between 45-50

It is important to create a target audience so that you know how to create your product, if you create something with no target you could very easily end up generating something that no one will enjoy.

However target audience can have its limitations, aiming to specifically at a specific audience can mean that those who are not within that audience can not want to.

# Demographics

A demographic is a specific groups that can be used in targeting for instance women, or people between 45-50.

Demographics are a way of categorizing people which could be seen as discrimination against people who are not in those groups, for instance a tooth brush 'for men' could be discriminatory against those who are not men.

Demographics simplify people into specific labels which is necessary when looking at a big scale but can be less than personal.
