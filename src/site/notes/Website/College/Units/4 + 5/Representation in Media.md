## ðŸŒˆRace

Racism is often used in a similar way that Nationality is. Most Americans already have a predisposed belief about black people and therefore black people in films are often portrayed this way. More modern films however often ignore race entirely and just have people who are of different races without it being a key detail. This could also be a misrepresentation though as it does not show how racism is in the real world, all though race is not in every conversation in the real world in a show with multiple hours of run time it strikes me as odd that not a single person is a racist. It can be argued that it is better to show a world without racism as after all fiction is about escapism.

More people of different race is a great thing as it allows more people to feel represented be media. Some films do not have any people of different races, like [LOTR.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien_and_race)

## ðŸŒˆSexismÂ 

In ninety percent of media sexism is not necessarily mentioned but instead just goes on as in real life, these are often based on realism as although some people will say "look at how poorly this films represents women" it is more about how these characters act. However recently there have been some films like "Barbie" have had a sole focus on sexism. These films are often aimed at female audiences and rather than addressing the problem are more about saying "this thing is a problem." There are also (often older) films which use gender as a character trait that can be used to tell the viewer things about the character, these are often based on stereotypes of women and men.

Video games particularly often do not have as much representation of women as they do men, this is likely because the developers know that more men will play, but in reality this is probably a reason why more men play than women.

## ðŸŒˆNationalityÂ 

Media often uses the stereotypes of different nationality to give a character predefined depth. For instance in the bond films Russians are often the villains as that is a stereotype many Brits already know. These stereotypes can often harm the image of different cultures. In a lot of action films these stereotypes are also used as a way to tell the viewer where the character is, for instance a women in head dress in the middle east, they also often use stereotypical music. For instance in the Mission Impossible films.

## ðŸŒˆSexualityÂ 

There are loads of examples of alternative sexuality in media. 1/5 people are gay, after all. However often being gay is used as a character trait that is loaded with other traits such as acting 'gay' In a more accurate piece of media the gayness would not be mentioned except in the context of relationships. In older media gay people often were not shown at all as it was a cultural issue that a lot of people did not want to know about it. This is a large issue which is recent years is definitely improving, though not entirely.

## ðŸŒˆReligionÂ 

Religion is not often represented in media. The only example I can think of is Good Omens. However even though this show is based entirely around the characters from the Bible it is not about religion not does it discriminate against those who do or do not believe in Big Man.

## ðŸŒˆDisabilitiesÂ 

Disability is not often represented in films, however to be fair it is not represented in real life either as to be fair how many people with debilitating disabilities are action heros. However in a lot of cases the actors playing these roles and the writers do not have experience with disability themselves. In some ways this is good as it means more films are made that draw attention to problems. But it can be a problem if they misrepresent the problem.

## My Representation

Do I think about representation in my work? To be honest not really. I have recently been working on something in a fantasy setting, and quite frankly it's on a continent with white people and immigration is zero to none. There are some gay people but they have no importance to the story. Mental disability is ignored and physical means you stay at home and don't get in the way of the story.

## In the Future

I try to create accurate representation in my creative projects. If I in the future work on a setting that allows for these things then I will try to create characters that include everyone.

## Why does it Matter

Proper representation allows viewers to see themselves on the big screen. Especially when playing a video game this sort of personalization allows you to relate to a character. But really it is just important that these things are a realistic representation of the world. In the real world there are gay people, in the real world there are black people, so why not in media? Some things need representing, racism and sexism are real issues.
