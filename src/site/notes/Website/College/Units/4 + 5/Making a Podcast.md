Let's interview someone about the LGBTs

## Target Audience

The first thing to consider is if this podcast will be aimed at those in, or not in the LGBT community. Which of these two groups can we provide value too. Those in likely are already knowledgable about, ya'know, themselves. So I think it is a safer bet to aim at those not in and give knowledge they might not know.

What age group do we want to be aimed towards? I reckon we should aim for an older audience. As younger people are likely already more knowledgable about this subject.

## Structure

The podcast will start with a brief description of LGBT and a jingle before having our guest introduce themselves and asking them questions. At the end I will reflect on what they have told me before saying goodbye.

1. What is LGBT.Q.I.A plus

# Editing

Editing was a simply job. I dragged in the track and started editing in waveform mode, I simply deleted bits I didn't want.

I quickly pressed the enhance button in audition. Improving the quality two fold

I then went into multi track mode and added an AI generated jingle to the beginning and end as well as some backing music
