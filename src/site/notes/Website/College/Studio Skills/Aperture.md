> [!Question] What is aperture?
> Aperture is the closing of a ring inside the lens that constricts light, and therefore changes the depth of field as well as light.

A low aperture means the ring is closed, a closed ring (obviously) means less light, but it also means that the depth of field will be shallow, no much is in focus.

A high aperture means the ring is open, a closed ringmeans less light, but it also means that the depth of field will be very low, much is in focus.
