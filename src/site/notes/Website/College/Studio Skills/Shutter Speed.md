> [!Question] What is shutter speed?
Shutter speed is the length of time that the sensor is open to light and therefore how long the camera catches light for.

If you have a slow shutter speed the sensor will be able to catch light for longer resulting in all actions taken over that time period captured. I other words blurry, and a slow speed can capture more light, a brighter image.

A fast shutter speed is the opposite. A fast shutter speed is means minimal motion blur but not much light can get in.
