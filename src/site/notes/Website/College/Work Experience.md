# Why I made this

Dérive is the french word for drifting.  Dérive is art created based on drifting through urban spaces, originating in Paris.

# How I made this

I used google street view to wander through both Paris and Herefordshire. I collected different elements and pasted them into Photoshop. I removed the backgrounds and layered the objects, starting with clouds and ending with the bike. Every element tells a story of the place it is from. Except for te portall frame I just thought that looked cool.
